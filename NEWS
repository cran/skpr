skpr v0.45.2 (Release date: 2018-01-22):
================

Major changes:

• Changed optimal search algorithm to return design with best aliasing structure (as determined by the alias matrix) when there is a tie between optimal designs. Increases likelyhood of producing an orthogonal design.

• Added support for mixture designs in evalulation functions. Generation is already supported in gen_design by removing the intercept from the model.

• Added support for backticked variables in evaluation functions and plotting functions. Made non-support for backticked variables explicit in gen_design.

• Added user-defined "custom" optimality option, where the user can define their own optimality criterion as an R function of the model matrix. This will be slower than the built-in criteria, but provides a great deal of flexibility--especially because the optimality functions can be written without any C. Function needs to be named "customOpt" and be in the global environment.

• Updated split-plot design generation to support Alias-optimal, T-optimal, and user-defined custom optimal designs. For custom designs, user needs to create a function named "customBlockedOpt" that is a function of the model matrix, as well as the variance-covariance matrix vInv. Should look like the following: customBlockedOpt = function(customdesign, vInv) {calculate optimality criterion}

• Implemented support for plot_correlations and plot_fds in output of eval_design_mc. Added required attributes to output.

Minor changes:

• Changed minDopt to 0.8 to return better screening designs.

• Changed default number of repeats to 20.

• Changed plot_correlations to use two-color scheme by default.

• Changed G-optimal design search to start from a D-optimal design.

• Added color to GUI design. Added ability to change color palettes.

• Added option to remove design randomization in GUI.

• Major UI updates for the GUI, changing the style away from default Shiny app.

Bug fixes:

• Changed singularity testing to use more robust function.

• Fixed E-optimal split-plot design generation.

• Fixed bug in split-plot non-singular design generation.

• Fixed is.numeric bug with plot_correlations in Shiny.

• Fixed bug with missing contrast list with hard-to-change factors. Fixed bug where factors were converted to integers with split-plot designs.

• Fixed bug in eval_design_survival_mc with contrast generation after reducing the run matrix.

• Fixed subsetting bug in automatic blocking column detection, turning on drop=FALSE. Fixed bug when external blocking columns were not ordered correctly. Changed name of internal block columns (Block# to skprBlock#) to make sure they don't interfere with user-generated columns.

• Fixed uninformative error message when optimality criterion not recognized when generating designs. Standardized input for optimality criterion to always use upper case.

• Updated/fixed/added unit tests.

skpr v0.40.1 (Release date: 2017-10-20):
================

• Fixed significant bug with parallel design generation that broke automatic detection of the number of cores available.

• Changed non-split-plot D-optimal design search to use modified Fedorov's algorithm with delta function (changed from modified Fedorov's, without delta function). Decreases search time for complex designs or designs with many trials.

• Turned off OPENMP warning for all c++ files.

skpr v0.39.0 (Release date: 2017-10-15):
================

• All the evaluation functions will now respect pre-set contrasts for categorical factors. If a contrast isn't set for a factor, it will use the contrast set in the contrasts argument. 

• Added the ability for the user to specify the number of cores manually by setting options(cores=). Otherwise, gen_design will use all cores available if parallel=TRUE.

• Added the ability for the user to interrupt the design search in gen_design for both single core and multicore searches. When user interrupts parallel search, gen_design will properly stop and close all connections.

• Added calculation of effect power for interaction terms and higher order terms.

• Changed eval_design so that the output always reports parameter power even if all factors are continuous.

• Fixed bug in eval_design_custom_mc which resulted in imported designs overwriting the generated list of contrasts with NULL.

• Changed delta argument to more descriptive "effectsize". Updated documentation and codebase to reflect this change. Effect size now accepts a length-two vector to either explicitly specify the difference in the high and low levels, or to specify GLM-family specific effect sizes. Updated GUI to reflect effectsize change.

• Changed Monte Carlo simulated estimates plot for exponential GLMs to show mean parameter rather than rate.

• Fixed bug when tibble was converted to data frame and didn't convert the character columns to factors. Turned off OPENMP warning in compilation

• Added support for ~.*. operator, allows user to specify full interaction model (no quadratic terms).

• Updated documentation.
